//I am thinking here (the Dashboard / Public Library) is the landing page where the user 
//searches or browses for and selects books to be sent to his own library-- then the UsersLibrary 
//is where their own books are and where you can delete, or update if you want the info
//And the Landing page is where the user can see books etc but must sign in to add books to his library 
//It says welcome to the library and allows them to add to their place and a button to navigate to their library
// ----- Maybe this is not the place it takes you at first? but when you sign in it takes you to your library
//unless its empty, and there it allows you to search for more books and that takes you here
