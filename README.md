# Your Library
### [Live-Website]: (Currently available at: 147.182.193.201:5656 ) (Domain name pending: https://yourlibrary.xyz)

## Description:
Your Library is a full-stack full CRUD website that is populated with book data from free books in the public domain from Project Gutenberg. The user can search among all the 60,000+ books available by author's name or title. The user can create an account and add whatever book from the public library (as sent by Gutenberg) into their own account, the data thereof being saved in a heroku database. The user can delete any book, or edit the book's data as they desire, from their our library. From either their own library or the public library the user can access the book's text by a link to that book's page on Project Gutenberg.
